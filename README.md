# Business Intelligence and Machine Learning for a Small Transport Company

## The Dataset
The dataset used in this project originates from EfficientRide Logistics, a hypothetical regional transportation service provider specializing in a diverse array of delivery needs in and around a bustling port city. The company operates within a strategic network encompassing customer distribution centers, retail stores, and carrier warehouses, thus establishing a robust logistics framework. The dataset contains comprehensive information about the company's orders, drivers, trailers, schedules, locations, and various events that affect orders. This data provides a detailed perspective of EfficientRide's logistics operations, enabling in-depth analysis and potential optimization of their operations.

## Establishing the Foundation: Defining the Objectives and Deliverables


### Problem Statement:

EfficientRide Logistics aims to enhance operational efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and make strategic decisions based on data-driven insights. However, the absence of an ERP system and the lack of modern data gathering techniques pose challenges in achieving these objectives.

### Project Objectives:

It is important for me to link every project to the core strategy of the business. In real life, the strategy of the business should be used as a guide to all projects. Let's say that EfficientRide Logistics strives to deliver the best service quality to its customers, ensuring prompt and reliable transportation services. The core strategies are:

- **Operational Efficiency:** Efficient utilization of drivers and equipment to maximize productivity.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Providing reliable and timely services to ensure high customer satisfaction.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Proactively identifying and managing potential risks to ensure smooth operations.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Leveraging data insights to inform strategic business decisions.

### Deliverables:

1. **Business Intelligence Report:** A comprehensive report visualizing the company's resources, demand, sales, and other key metrics, using Power BI.
2. **Sales Forecasting Model:** A machine learning model to forecast future sales based on historical data.
3. **Risk Assessment Model:** A machine learning model to identify potential risks such as delays, damages, or cancellations.
4. **Customer Satisfaction Assessment:** A component that evaluates customer satisfaction based on data such as feedback scores, number of complaints, and number of late or rescheduled deliveries.
5. **Data Gathering Techniques:** Implement modern data gathering techniques such as voice-to-text for order status updates and license plate recognition to update the yard list.

By clearly defining the problem, the project objectives, and the deliverables, we ensure that the project aligns with the company's strategy and meets the needs of the customers. This clarity helps set the direction for the subsequent phases of the project.

# EfficientRide Logistics: Measure Phase

In this phase of the project, I'll be primarily focused on gathering and measuring the data from various sources like orders, drivers, trailers, schedules, locations, and events. This data will provide a quantitative basis for the analysis and will help in understanding the current state of the business operations.
