# Business Intelligence and Machine Learning for a Small Transport Company

## The Dataset
The dataset used in this project originates from EfficientRide Logistics, a hypothetical regional transportation service provider specializing in a diverse array of delivery needs in and around a bustling port city. The company operates within a strategic network encompassing customer distribution centers, retail stores, and carrier warehouses, thus establishing a robust logistics framework. The dataset contains comprehensive information about the company's orders, drivers, trailers, schedules, locations, and various events that affect orders. This data provides a detailed perspective of EfficientRide's logistics operations, enabling in-depth analysis and potential optimization of their operations.

## Why am I making these projects
I am making this portfolio to illustrate how a small or midsize transport company, without a pre-existing ERP system, can utilize modern data gathering techniques, business intelligence, and machine learning to improve operational efficiency, inform strategic decision-making, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Methodology
Using a methodology is a good way to structure our projects. Since I use a plethora of tools and documents, I borrow methodologies from Agile and Six Sigma to structure these documents.

## The DMAIC Methodology
Our first approach follows the principles of the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology:

**Define:** The first step involves defining the problem and the project objectives clearly. In this case, the problem is to improve the operational efficiency of the transport company, increase customer satisfaction, and enable data-driven decision-making. The objective is to use business intelligence, machine learning, and modern data gathering techniques to achieve these goals.

**Measure:** In this step, we gather and measure the data from various sources like orders, drivers, trailers, schedules, locations, and events. This data provides a quantitative basis for our analysis and helps us understand the current state of the business operations.

**Analyze:** The collected data is then analyzed using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for data visualization. We identify trends, patterns, and areas of improvement in the operations. We also use machine learning algorithms to predict future sales, identify potential risks, and forecast customer satisfaction.

**Improve:** Based on the insights derived from the analysis, we suggest improvements in the existing processes and strategies. This might involve optimizing driver and equipment schedules, implementing proactive risk mitigation measures, or enhancing customer communication and real-time tracking.

**Control:** In this final step, we monitor the implementation and effects of the improvements to ensure that they deliver the expected benefits. We set up control charts and other monitoring mechanisms to keep track of key performance indicators. We also continue to iterate on our models and strategies as needed, to adapt to changes in the business environment or operations.

By following the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology, we ensure a systematic, data-driven approach to problem-solving and process improvement. This methodology allows us to provide EfficientRide Logistics with actionable insights and recommendations to enhance their operations and service quality.

## Establishing the Foundation: Defining the Objectives and Deliverables

In the Define phase, we establish the goals of the project in relation to the company's strategy and customer demands. This step involves clearly defining the problem, the project objectives, and the deliverables.

### Problem Statement:

EfficientRide Logistics aims to enhance operational efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and make strategic decisions based on data-driven insights. However, the absence of an ERP system and the lack of modern data gathering techniques pose challenges in achieving these objectives.

### Project Objectives:

It is important for me to link every project to the core strategy of the business. In real life, the strategy of the business should be used as a guide to all projects. Let's say that EfficientRide Logistics strives to deliver the best service quality to its customers, ensuring prompt and reliable transportation services. The core strategies are:

- **Operational Efficiency:** Efficient utilization of drivers and equipment to maximize productivity.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Providing reliable and timely services to ensure high customer satisfaction.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Proactively identifying and managing potential risks to ensure smooth operations.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Leveraging data insights to inform strategic business decisions.

### Deliverables:

1. **Business Intelligence Report:** A comprehensive report visualizing the company's resources, demand, sales, and other key metrics, using Power BI.
2. **Sales Forecasting Model:** A machine learning model to forecast future sales based on historical data.
3. **Risk Assessment Model:** A machine learning model to identify potential risks such as delays, damages, or cancellations.
4. **Customer Satisfaction Assessment:** A component that evaluates customer satisfaction based on data such as feedback scores, number of complaints, and number of late or rescheduled deliveries.
5. **Data Gathering Techniques:** Implement modern data gathering techniques such as voice-to-text for order status updates and license plate recognition to update the yard list.

By clearly defining the problem, the project objectives, and the deliverables, we ensure that the project aligns with the company's strategy and meets the needs of the customers. This clarity helps set the direction for the subsequent phases of the project.

# EfficientRide Logistics: Measure Phase

In this phase of the project, I'll be primarily focused on gathering and measuring the data from various sources like orders, drivers, trailers, schedules, locations, and events. This data will provide a quantitative basis for the analysis and will help in understanding the current state of the business operations.
