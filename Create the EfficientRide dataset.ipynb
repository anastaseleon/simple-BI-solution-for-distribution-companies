    "\n",
    "## Orders\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry in the dataset represents an individual order. Key information recorded includes:\n",
    "- Order ID\n",
    "- Pickup date\n",
    "- Lead time\n",
    "- Volume\n",
    "- Status (Delivered, On the Way, Not Picked Up)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional details related to the delivery are included:\n",
    "- Delivery type (Direct or Not Direct)\n",
    "- Delivery date\n",
    "- Pickup address\n",
    "- Delivery location\n",
    "- Trailer requirement for each order\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equipment and Drivers\n",

    "- Unique ID for each driver\n",
    "\n",
    "## Events, Cost, and Profit\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also records:\n",
    "- Any issues that occurred during the delivery process (Events)\n",
    "- The cost incurred for each order\n",
    "- The profit generated from each order\n",
    "\n",
    "## Location Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed location data is included, with:\n",
    "- Latitude and longitude for each location\n",
    "- Location types: Ports, Customer DC, Customer Stores, and Carrier Warehouses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Driver Information\n",
